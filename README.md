# Sentiment-Analysis-on-Youtube-Videos
This project uses a deep learning approach that employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) to analyze facial emotions and Lexicon and Rule-based Approach (VADER sentiment) for analyzing the comments. CNN is more efficient and accurate in processing images to analyze sentiments. 

Traditionally, Sentiment Analysis is a natural language processing (NLP) technique that involves automatically identifying the sentiment of a piece of text. In recent years, the popularity of video content has increased significantly compared to text, as information can be conveyed quickly and effectively. Social media platforms such as YouTube gained a lot of popularity. Understanding the thoughts and opinions of YouTube users requires understanding the sentiment of the videos on the network. With YouTube's increasing user base, it is now more crucial than ever to examine the sentiment represented in videos to understand what the general public thinks about various issues. This project intends to create a sentiment analysis model that can precisely identify and categorize sentiments from YouTube videos and Comments using techniques like CNN, Haar-Cascade Classifier, and Vader Sentiment and to provide a user interface for analyzing the sentiment in YouTube videos. Assessing any video for its emotional content is simple because the system is based on a webpage that lets people submit their own videos or offer a link to a YouTube video. The project's findings show how well facial expression and comment sentiment analysis may be integrated to thoroughly comprehend the emotional content of YouTube videos.

Objectives:
1)	Create a Sentiment analysis model that takes YouTube videos and comments.
2)	Create a User-Interface that provides an interface for the user to submit the link or the video on which he would like to perform analysis.
3)	Increase the systemâ€™s efficiency and reduce the time taken for analysis.
